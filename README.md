### Hi there! I'm AurumByte ðŸ‘‹

I'm a glitch who loves to create stuff with code.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [Crypt](https://github.com/Crypt-Language/Crypt)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Java (properly)
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open source projects (which I can help with)
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with implementation for a couple of features (Arrays, etc.) and issue fixes for [Crypt](https://github.com/Crypt-Language/Crypt). 

Formerly [CodeUnstable](https://github.com/CodeUnstable). Changed to (Created) another GitHub profile.

Old Profile stuff (Blog, articles) etc. will stay on GitHub until moved to this account.
