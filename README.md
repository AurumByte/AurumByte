### Hi there! I'm CodeGlytch 👋

I'm a glitch who loves to create stuff with code.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on Cylvre
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java (properly)
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects (which I can help with)
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with implementation for a couple of features (Arrays, etc.) and issue fixes. 

Formerly [CodeUnstable](https://github.com/CodeUnstable). Changed to (Created) another GitHub profile.

Old Profile stuff (Blog, articles) etc. will stay on GitHub until moved to this account.
